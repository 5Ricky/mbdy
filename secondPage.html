        <p>Dear Moto,</p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is a very special day for you (and me also). You bring so much joy and light into 
            my life. I just don't know what will I do without you. <b>May all your wishes come true</b> and fill your life with lots of enjoyment and love. 
            All I want to say is, <b>Happy Birthday</b> and... 
            Thank you for being the beautiful, remarkable person that you are. I am endlessly grateful for your presence in my life. 
            Here's another year of beautiful memories together.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for now let's look at some of our previous special memories. Just touch below.  <b>Have a Good day.</b></p>
        <p class="name">Your Supriya Da</p>
